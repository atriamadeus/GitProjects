## Location Selection Problem:

A company sells and services copy machines to customers in 11 cities throughout the country. 
The company wants to set up service centers in three of these cities. After the company chooses the
location of the service centers, it must assign customers in each city to cone of the service centers. 
For example, if it decides to locate a service center in New York and then assigns its Boston customers 
to the New York service center, a service representative from New York will travel from Boston when services are required there.
The distances (in miles) between the cities are provided, also the estimated annual numbers of trips to the various customers
are given. 
What should thew company do to minimize the total annual distance traveled by its service representative? 

Objective: To develop a linear model, using binary variables, that determines the locations of service centers 
and then assigns customers to these service centers to minimize the total annual distance traveled.
